This implementation of the rules based AutoTables algorithm only includes 3 sample operations: Pivot, Tranpose, Wide-to-Long

The algorithm relies on the sample dataset dimension. A 1D table is detected as the pivot operation, while a 2D table is detected as either the Tranpose or Wide-to-Long opertion. To differenate between Tranpose and Wide-to-Long, the algorithm looks at the rows to determine of the datatypes of those values are similar. If they are considered the same datatype, then is detected as a Transpose opertaion, else it is a Wide-to-Long operation.

There are 3 algorithms to generate the data. Upon each execution of these generation algorithms, new data will be generate for testing.



STEPS TO REPRODUCE RESULTS:

    Step 1) Execute the any of the first 3 code blocks, titled "Generate data for the Rule Based AutoTable Algorithm ([operation name] Operation)". Each block will generate different data for a specific operation type.

    Step 2) Execute the last code block titled "Test Rule Based AutoTable Algorithm". This section will run the autotable() function with three different datasets. Each dataset is named after the operation required to transform the data.

    Step 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 as desired. To execute the autotables() function on a different dataset yet same operation, new data will have to be generated by executing the respective data generation code block.
